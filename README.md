DNA sequence classification is a fundamental task in bioinformatics with wide applications in 
gene prediction, disease detection, and regulatory element identification. However, the inherent 
complexity and variability of genomic sequences make accurate classification a challenging 
problem. Traditional machine learning models often fall short in capturing the long-range 
dependencies and contextual significance of nucleotide patterns. In this study, we propose an 
Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model designed to 
effectively classify DNA sequences by leveraging both sequential context and positional 
relevance. The BiLSTM component captures bidirectional dependencies in the sequence, while 
the attention mechanism enhances the modelâ€™s ability to focus on biologically important 
regions. The model is trained on benchmark genomic datasets and evaluated using accuracy, 
precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that the 
proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional methods, offering a robust and 
interpretable solution for DNA sequence classification. This framework provides a foundation 
for more accurate and biologically meaningful sequence analysis in computational genomics.
